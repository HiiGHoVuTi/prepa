Liz Truss' economic reforms, consisting mostly in decreasing tax and refusing to give any more financial aid, have been suject to plenty of scrutiny. 
They were labeled a neoliberal measure unreasonably trusting the free market.
In a time of economic unease which the free market arguably caused, such measures seem counter productive or too oriented towards the rich, trusting trickle down theory to save the rest. 
Most of all, ~~Liberals~~ hold grudges against her as she used to be a Democrat activist and changed convictions as she gained status all the way up until becoming Prime Minister.
